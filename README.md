# Pebble Jive Actions Box
This is a Jive Actions inbox for the Pebble Watch. Receive action items and respond to them right from you Pebble watch!

**Uses the Clay library to display config from phone storage instead of an externally hosted configuration screen.
*This is currently beta

# Usage
Install it on your watch, enter your Jive instance URL (e.g. xxxxx.jiveon.com), username, and password in the phone's Pebble App configuration screen for Jive Actions. If the login information is good, it will retrieve the list of actions in your inbox and you can respond to the item by selecting it and the action you want to give.

# Development
Please see the comments in the code for explainations of how it works
